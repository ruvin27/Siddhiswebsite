          I like it how people say school friends don't last forever, but guess what I have our friendship to prove them wrong 🥺
Bro I'm so grateful to have you in my life you're super talented, super understanding and you're such a good listener, we've come along way, it's been so many years of togetherness & nothing's changed, yes I agree we might not meet on a regular basis but whenever we do , everything makes up for it🤍
Absolutely love how shameless & crazy we can be around each other, Cheers to all our silly sleepovers and can't wait for many many many more oof
Thankyou for being there for me always , I love you Sidddhiiiii😘
Happy Birthday Babe✨

          Happy Birthday to you siddhiii
Aab 21 saal ki ho gyi toh thoda behave bhi karle vaise , thoda mature hoja.
Thank me later for not hitting you when you irritate me huhh . I used to think that you were just born bossy, then I realized you were just born first- so I guess you’re off the hook since you were just being a sister.No one can make me laugh like you do – especially when I look at your face.Sis, you drink way too much. You cuss way too much. You have somewhat questionable morals. You’re everything I could ever want in a sister aur tu meko chutiya bol sakti hai 😂 happy birthday lots of love❤️
